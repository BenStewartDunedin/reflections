When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
 work local?
When you are colaborating with other people.
When you are submitting work to a build or test server.
For software reviews.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
 automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might be working on a change locally that you don't want to push to
the remote repository as it is not complete.
You might be working in the same area of code as another developer, if they
commit to the remote repository you don't want the commit affecting your work.
