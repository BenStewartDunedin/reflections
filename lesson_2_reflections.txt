What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
An empty repository is created in your working directory.
You need to do it because you need somewhere to send your commits.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
 repository?
It's an intermediate step that lets you group files together before commiting
them 
What value do you think it offers?
By grouping files together you can commit a change that is implemented 
in several files
It makes you think about the commit before starting, there should be less
rework of commits because simple mistakes can be caught in the staging area.
