What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
An empty repository is created in your working directory.
You need to do it because you need somewhere to send your commits.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
 repository?
It's an intermediate step that lets you group files together before commiting
them 
What value do you think it offers?
By grouping files together you can commit a change that is implemented 
in several files
It makes you think about the commit before starting, there should be less
rework of commits because simple mistakes can be caught in the staging area.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
 logical change?
You can use it as a pre-commit area, by using git diff you can check
that only the changes associated with the change you want to commit
will be added in this commit.
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
 history organized?
Where you wanted to try a new idea without breaking your functioning
code.
Where you wanted to implement a new feature that may not be wanted.
Where you want to significantly refactor your code.
How would branches help?
By leaving the original branch alone you can try these ideas without
risking your functioning code.
